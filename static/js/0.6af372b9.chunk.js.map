While only \r\n             being an undergrad who is mostly self-taught in the area of machine learning via mostly online \r\n             blog posts and videos, it's going to be an interesting journey with what I assume are many bumps in the road.\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className={style.para}>\r\n            \"But Why plants?\" I can hear you asking. In modern society, invasive species are an issue causing imbalances \r\n            in the eco-system leading to devastating effects. In this project, we can use plants as our 'testing ground'\r\n            for more advanced applications of this technology and at the same time create a meaningful product that can \r\n            be used by a wide variety of people to better the planet. The project aims to create a mobile app that is easy \r\n            to use for users to be able to take a photo of a plant and determine if it is an invasive species.\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n          <div className={style.para}>\r\n            The basic idea of the project is to create a mobile app that anyone can use with ease after \r\n            a simple download from the android store allowing them to help stop or avoid invasive plants. \r\n            We can see this being used in the line of work of County Foresters or the US Forest Service in \r\n            Vermont along with general nature enthusiasts and depending on the route we take, for educational \r\n            purposes as well. \r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n          <div className={style.para}>\r\n            As it currently stands the project is going to use a convolutional neural network or CNN, \r\n            to determine the type of plant in the photo. If performance is lacking we will think about moving over \r\n            to a YOLOv5 network. After we determine the plant in the photo we then use GPT-3 to generate a \r\n            general description of the plant using its name and a simple prompt. In addition to this (while it is a stretch goal) \r\n            we will then use the image provided to generate a physical description of the plant. Preferably we will be using \r\n            my own convolutional neural network library for the first CNN but this is also a stretch goal.\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}   \r\n\r\nexport default Post;"],"sourceRoot":""}
