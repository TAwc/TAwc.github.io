The problem is, it\u2019s basically impossible to do EFFICIENTLY. While it is possible to do after many posts are created, due to how to react works the basic approach will cause slow run times and create a rendering of elements users never see. The approach I created remedies these issues and makes a tedious process that will slow your website down into something that efficiently serves HTML to the user. While the system isn\u2019t perfect and requires some grunt work, it won\u2019t cause users to render HTML code that they will never see."),o.a.createElement("div",{className:p.a.para},"I have scavenged the internet for a better approach to this topic with these restrictions and have come up with little to nothing as an answer.
